k8s-seminar config
===

This repository holds the configuration to deploy [mattmezza/k8s-seminar-app](https://github.com/mattmezza/k8s-seminar-app).

This configuration is for a kubernetes cluster. You can find:
- `infra.md`: this holds some more info on how to get a k8s cluster up and running on your local machine (via `minikube`)
- `deployment`: this holds the config files to deploy the web app on the k8s cluster
- `watch`: to observe some command without having to execute it manually over and over again

To install all of these utilities, please use your OS package manager (something like `brew` for mac or `choco` for Windows).
